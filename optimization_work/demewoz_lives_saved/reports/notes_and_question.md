# Notes and Question about Effective Coverage Simulations

7/1/2020:

- Check with Steve about BAU's:
  - VA - oilvas
  - Zinc - oil
  - Folic Acid (WRA) - some  fflourzflouriflourb12flour intervention
  - These don't seem in line with what Demewoz sent
    - Even if that's the case, Demewoz didn't send SE for the BAU
    - Even if that's the case, how do I combine them?
- If so, I need effective coverage measures for fflour, zflour, iflour b12flour...
  - As well as oil if that's correct
